## Game Instructions

The game deck consists of 4 different types of cards:

- Cat card 🐱
- Defuse card 🚫
- Shuffle card 🔀
- Exploding kitten card 💣

When the game starts, there will be a deck of 5 cards ordered randomly. Each time a user clicks on the deck, a card is revealed and removed from the deck. A player wins the game once all 5 cards are drawn, and there are no cards left in the deck.

## Rules

- If the drawn card is a cat card, it is removed from the deck.
- If the card is an exploding kitten (bomb), the player loses the game.
- A defusing card can be used to defuse one bomb from subsequent cards drawn.
- If the card is a shuffle card, the game restarts, and the deck is refilled with 5 cards.

## Assumptions

- The game currently lacks user authentication.
- On startup, the game assigns a random username. If not changed/confirmed, scores won't be saved.
- If you choose a username that doesn't exist, a new user will be created.
- The game polls the database every 8 seconds for real-time updates in the leaderboard table.
